<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] heeey, it IS uru-Brice</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> thanks for making me a guest rc</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] shorah RC gah Brice</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> np  :)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[TW] hey, Brice!</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> I have to work off my debt somehow  ^_~</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> I didnt know CC was still here !</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice zomg!</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Mr. Plasma-man! *faints*</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> Didnt i comment on your blog once Para?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] CC's never left!</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] since 1997  &lt;.&lt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> CC will out live C</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yep :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] haha  : )</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] heh, it did at once time...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> whats new</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i havent been in here in a few YEARS</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">/////</span> [Tahgtahv]  &lt;links in from somewhere on the internet Age&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">\\\\\</span></span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; What would you think of a "Plasma Development Studio" application? &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> What does that mean</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Basically a tool that could edit all of the keyed classes to create user-content</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> like for uru</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> or for fun</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] fun mostly (it would probably be designed for the 63.12 version of Path of the Shell)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> fun is always good</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Although, there's a "Guild of Writers" in Uru Live now, so you never know what the future might bring ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> the future is made by people</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> who is the guild of writers</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> players</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> or cyanists</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> players i think</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] looks like it'll be players</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> it's like a club right nowyou</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span>  go to a neighborhood, click to sign up and get a tshirt</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> oooo a shirt</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> thats almost the same as creating the universe</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] There have been tools for the open-source modelling program Blender that could export to Uru's PRP Format; then a few of us have been working on HuruStudio (which is the multi-purpose Plasma Development Studio)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> Brice&gt; Almost  ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] shirts ARE the universe</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> why not just pirate max?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] what would that give?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> its better than blender...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Well, I would, but I can't see Cyan's legal department being too happy if I go and tell anyone interested in Age Creation to do so :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] I like Blender &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] Blender hurts my brain.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] it's easy to code for (apparently)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> how is uru live doing?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] not too bad</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i have never played uru</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] that's ironic</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> my copy is unopened</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] well, aside from the lack of storyline, very limited and low quality Ages, and "Plasma-oddness"; Uru Live isn't doing abd</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] hmm, ya</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] and I fear those things are gonna get worse before they get better</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> Define plasma oddness</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] They went with PhysX instead of Havok... Let's all watch the subworlds break when you exit an elevator and fall through the geometry &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] more like physics oddness, not Plasma</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> Umm, isn't that always how the elevators worked?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> The phyxics was a pain in the original Havok based uru too</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I've never fallen through an elevator</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] Jalak :D</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> All in all i wish we had kept the plasma 1.0 physics</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] what was that?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> Why didn't y'all?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Chan &gt; In PotS you could at least step out of it onto a solid surface; PhysX must skip some region detection sometimes</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] uhm, I've fallen through Teledahn, Gahreesen, Er'Cana, and Jalak</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] O.o</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> Para&gt; PotS was singleplayer</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> The 1.0 physics didnt do everything but it worked</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; Plasma 1 had a physics engine? (Mark repeatedly denies that it did)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> that depends on what you think physics is</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Chan &gt; Doesn't matter, collision was still handled better than in MOUL</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; yeah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] RealMyst definitely had walkable geometry</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> right</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] that was 1 right?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> yes</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> i thought realmyst was plasma 1.5?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I was playing just the other day actually</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> who's counting</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> true  :)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> my kid is playing it on gametap</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] We've been trying to &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> he says its hard</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> they branch it for every project  x.x</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] ya, we just recently figured out what Myst V is</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> pssh, i played myst when i was 7  ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">/////</span> [wandering_nomad]  &lt;links in from somewhere on the internet Age&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">\\\\\</span></span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I didn't have a computer then :\</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] think I was 11</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[wandering_nomad] You can just yuse a sheep!</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i was older</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Chan &gt; yep... 1 - realMyst; 2.0 - ABM; 2.0.1 - PotS/CC; 2.1 - MV/CT; 2.&lt;random number&gt; - MOUL</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Sorry for the delayed responses, I'm getting some horrible lag here</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] we don't have any idea on Moul?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> nobody here is keeping track anymore i think  ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> Heck i dont know what version Moul is</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] I'll venture a guess at 2.2; but it's kinda a mix between 2.0.1 and 2.1</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> stuff was taken out befween uru and mV</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> so in some ways the past is the future</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> and vicey versa</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> but that was all After me</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I'm going to say Moul is 2.0, officially</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] but they are reworking a lot of code</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; How much of realMyst is there in Uru (code-wise)? (or technically from my point of view, how much Uru is there in realMyst?)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I would say not a lot</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] poor brice... getting grilled for hacking pruposes... ;-p</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] the file format, physics, and even the DX version have all changed since then</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] lol, more for interest purposes than hacking purposes</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[wandering_nomad] How much Realmyst is there in SOurce?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] and those sections make up a big portion</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> the realmyst code is pretty different</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> esp the graphics</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> completely diff</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] figured that</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] what version was RealMyst?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] I don't suppose the .dni files contained anything resembling the KeyedObject classes of today?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] in terms of DirectX?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] or did it even use that</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> used dx</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> but not really T&amp;l</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> no the keyed object system was new for plasma 2.0</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> actuall p2.0 was built around it</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] ah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah... I noticed that :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I believe that's where we get the name PRP from as well?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> ii forget</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Plasma Registry Page if I recall correctly (or Packed Registry Page judging from some of the other stuff)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> that doesnt sound right but maybe</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] heh, maybe they had something else in mind</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Rivenchan wishes she understood what y'all are talking about *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] *shrugs* We don't exactly have "A Plasma Hacker's handbook" here :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] but plRegistryPage is kind of a big player in management of the files</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] sleep time byyyyyyyeeeee</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[wandering_nomad] bye woof</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] cya GS</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] g'night GS</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Tahg &gt; yeah, plRegistryPageNode and plPackedSourceData</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[GermanShepherd] raaaaawr *poof*</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">\\\\\</span> [GermanShepherd]  &lt;links safely back to their home Age&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">/////</span></span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] btw, Brice, this _isn't_ an interrogation session; you can ask us to stop at any time :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] ya, we're just curious people</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> its ok</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Rabid Plasma people who tend to get really excited really easily &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] tho I suspect we may know a lot more about the state of the current engine</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> probably so</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> im looking at some archives of old old stuff</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] cool</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i am looking at some of the oldest plasma pictures</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Tahgtahv idly wonders if that stuff contains any source *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] The ones that were on eDog's site?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> the original plamsa ran on glide</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> probably</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] wow</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> the first plasma ran on the voodoo 1</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> pII 200mhz</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] wow</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">/////</span> [RIUM+]  &lt;links in from somewhere on the internet Age&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: lime;">\\\\\</span></span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> what was on edogs site</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Arrr</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> hey rium</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> hi Rium  :)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] ooou, Brice! Haven't seen you in a while! :D</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; It had a humaoid shape inside a ... thing with curvy walls and a little tree IIRC</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] curvy walls and a little tree?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> hmm</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> not sure what that was</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Kahlo?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> ok lets play guess the date for this image</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> no fair looking at the timestamps</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> http://www.northnitch.com/~nikto/Newjpg.JPG</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] which image?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] that one =P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] ah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> wow you do have lag para</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> btw. sorry for the slow server</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> http://www.hapshaw.com/3D/3dhistory.htm  &lt;-  this stuff?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah, I'm torrenting a LiveCD &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> sure sure</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Chan &gt; Yes!</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] In the "Early HeadSpin 3d" section</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> :)  See, ask an artisty question and i'm all over it  ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Tahgtahv turns laptop on side *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Brice&gt; hmm... 1999?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] heh</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> close</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> 1998</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] woah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> edog modelled almost all of that</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> maybe all</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> *looks again&amp;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] that's a long time ago</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] riven was released in 1999 IIRC?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] '97 for Riven</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] oh, ok</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> we did a couple of riven mock ups in plasma</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> but i cant find them</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> wow, that'd be cool to see  :)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] realRiven! ;P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> probably wouldn't be too difficult to do nowadays</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I would've liked real Revelation</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> just a bit labor intensive, and, y'know, pointless</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> pointless yes</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Chan &gt; lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] If I ever have a spare $100 million bucks, I'll make realRiven &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i found the plamsa data set for the riven stuff but no screenies</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> lol  :)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Well, y'know... you could always send us the data stuff to disassemble ;P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] heh</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> true, they could probably do it, too  ;)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] no prolly about it</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> probably so</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] RIUM &gt; lol</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Paradox lags really badly and looks weird with his out-of-place responses *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I noticed</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Oooh http://www.hapshaw.com/3D/DireboBridge.jpg</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Brice  rumages through more old backup *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Cyan seem more open to external work if you're willing to pay for it... just look at the Crowthistle work they did &gt;.&gt; all I need is enough money to pay 'em out the wazoo for realRiven :D</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> none of my stuff runs. Maybe i need a voodoo card</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] you'd think they'd be happy with external work for free :\</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] or, um</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] oh, them doing external work</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Well if you want to send us the original stuff Brice, we can hammer away and use a Glide wrapper to get it working again for you. ;P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] (actually, he's right, we probably could, and we'd likely be more than willing to) :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> im not sure who owns what anymore</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] :\</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] some combination of Cyan, Ubisoft, GameTap, and Mattel?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah, that would be confusing... who owns the code that was written before bought HeadSpin, what if it was never used, etc.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I would think that would be spelled out somewhere</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> i could care less about ubi</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] heh</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] before Cyan bought HeadSpin*</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I noticed Brouderbound still hosts support files for RealMyst</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> broderbund still exists?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] apparently</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: cyan;">[Rivenchan]</span> wow</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] the site does anyway</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] with info on how to get RM to work on XP</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] heh, You have no hope with rM on XP (and even less hope on Vista)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] and a general mention of Vista tips for their games</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] Vista wasn't specifically for RM</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] (or as Paradox says, applicable at all)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> my tip for vista is</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> buy  a mac</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] maybe when we push UE to the Mac</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] My tip is, get Linux and run everything in WINE</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] eh?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] I wish I could move to linux. There's just some windows-based apps that have no comparison that I can't leave behind, and they don't work well with emulation as I need the speed. :(</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] Paradox     My tip is, get Linux and run everything in WINE</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Oh, yeah, MOUL doesn't play nicely with WINE because someone decided to use I/O Completion Ports</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] RIUM &gt; Myst V works better in WINE than it does natively &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] :\</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Nadnerb] and that's just strange.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Doxy&gt; it's not a high priority for WINE developers to fix software that I use at work, since only 100 people worldwide use it really.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Ah :(</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Any other images to show us of early plasma stuff, Bricey? :D</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Nadnerb] yeah! I'm lovin these images! (and saving them)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> *looking at old internal plamsa docs. still cant find what prp stood for</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] heh... are those docs under copyright? &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> All of the important game data is stored in a SQL database that we refer to as the vault. Sometimes CCRs will need to edit this data. So that CCRs would not have to deal with the SQL database directly we are building a Vault Manager tool for editing this data. This Vault manager is a separate application from the client that only CCRs would have.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] yes, we had that at one point...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Vault is Orcale now :(</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Oracle*</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Nadnerb] what does CCR stand for, anyway?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Customer Care Representative (officially)</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] ya, he knows lots =P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] not as much as other people... want Vault stuff, go ask Deledrius (who wrote his own Vault Manager)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] we all know our areas</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] lol, that sounds like we're some sort of mastermind organization; but it's true</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] "And this, this is Frank. Frank is world-renowned for his skills at making coffee. He's a very valuable member of the team."</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Did he say a bad word or have computer troubles?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] bad word is a "links safely"</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] You wouldn't happen to have any documentation for plHKPhysical would you? &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> highly unlikely</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] darn, that's one of the few classes that keeps stumping us</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> its just a wrapper on HKphysical right?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] plHKPhysical stored the collision type and the vertex data for teh collider</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] I'm assuming it also stores internal Havok data; but we can't get ahold of the Havok SDK without buying it</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Marein] IE can't find my proxy, again, but I'm guessing it's the Choru cleft wall</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] vaahty, that's the cleft wall</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] No... we just want to understand it so that we can implement more collision features</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] vaaht &gt; Ask Nisan about it :P</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] i know...i want the original picture</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] not the inverted colors one</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Ah it's got it</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] beta</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] what imager message?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] The imager didn't have a message &gt;.&gt;</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Brice = Nikto?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] All the people in beta were all too busy going "OMGOMGOMG it's THE CLEFT!!!"</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] And then when they added the stuff from Riven, everyone was busy going "OMGOMGOMG RIVEN ENDS HERE!!!"</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> the same</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Well, I can understand</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Brice: neato</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] rium&gt; what about adding the stuff from riven...?</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Marein] And when was this all exactly? Was this with the Authorized Explorers?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] yeah, loooong ago o.o</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Heh yeah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] early 2000's?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] rium&gt; what "items"?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Hmm... I don't remember what the writing on the wall says... what's it say, vaaht?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] 2002</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[vaaht] oh, duh  : )</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] And the Riven telescope but I can't find that so quickly</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Brice &gt; cool</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] is that forwards or backwards (toward 2001)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> forwards</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] ah</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] What do you mean, 'working my way to 2001'?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> im going through old archives</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> you missed the guess the date game</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Tahgtahv doesn't know much about who worked on what when *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] He's going through old Plasma archives</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Ah hehe</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] That reminds me I need to clean the rest of my files...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] I cleared 15 GB the other day, now I need to do my huge desktop and the rest of my inmense "D'ni" folder</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] oh look, it's getting light outside at my place :\</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] these all nighters are taxing to say the least</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Oh, Brice, you were the one who asked Colin to add the xTEA encryption right? (and then asked him to change it after Beta testers started wondering about the 'BriceIsSmart' header)</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Tahg &gt; heh</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] encryption was never a real strong point</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Colin did his best &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] lol</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] BriceIsSmart, hee...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] ya, he asked me about it later</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] that was about the time he left I think</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> colin was funny</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> also really smart</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah, when Cyan closed, Colin left... not sure what he's doing nowadays</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> he is a lead dev at a company in tx</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Ah cool</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] see, if you just XORd "whatdoyousee" by 0x12345678 or something, it would make it harder to find</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] lots of things you could do to improve it really</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> heh</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> what makes you think we tried hard?</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] nothing</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] yeah, those XOR'd strings in Myst V were a pain &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[RIUM+] Enough to discourage basic sniffing &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] I doubt it was much of a priority</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> there were alot of case where we were in over our heads</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] although I can say, once GT came on bored, security got a LOT stricter</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> security was one</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] er, board*</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] via an emulator thing, yes (only works on Intel Macs)</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] http://cho.cyan.com/RAWA/MystVTimelapses/jpgs/Laki/Windmill/Simon.jpg - Simon</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span>  http://www.northnitch.com/~nikto/simon.jpg</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] No idea what the last name was...</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> Through the main character, Simon Venture, the player vicariously explores a set of mysterious worlds.  Each of the worlds has its own theme which ties together the puzzles and characters of that world. Only a few of these worlds are immediately accessible.</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Tahgtahv] can't get it to play</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Paradox] Ah cool</span><br />
<span style="color: white;"><span style="color: gold;">[Brice]</span> Simon is a sort of Generation X version of Indiana Jones. Part hacker, part extreme sports athlete, he is just as comfortable on an inverted rock climb as he is hacking the IRS Central Database security system. While he has no formal training in martial arts he has watched enough Jackie Chan flixs to execute some cool moves to delight the player. Simon is a wisecracker and the perfect partner for the players trip into the unknown.</span><br />
<span style="color: yellow;">** Tahgtahv thinks he should prolly install QT *</span><br />
<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Haharharhahr</span><br />

<span style="color: white;">[Marein] Also is there any way to save that superpreUru movie?</span><br />
